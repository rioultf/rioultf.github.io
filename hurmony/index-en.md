# Tonality Visualization

This work aims to provide a dynamic visualization of tonality throughout a musical sequence.

1. each score is arranged as a *quartet* from the original
2. then exported in `MusicXML` format
3. the [`Verovio` application](https://editor.verovio.org/) converts the `MusicXML` format to `MEI`, another XML version (which can also be obtained through [XSLT transformation](https://github.com/music-encoding/encoding-tools))
4. the [`Humdrum Extras` library](https://extras.humdrum.org) converts the `MusicXML` format to `hum` and performs tonal analysis
5. I assemble everything into JSON after various processing steps to generate the visualization

## Tonality Computation

The harmony data is provided by the [`mkeyscape`](https://extras.humdrum.org/man/mkeyscape/) utility, which defines an *analysis step*, here set to the *eighth note*. For example, on the 26 four-beat measures of the reference Bach BWV555, `mkeyscape` computes, for 26 * 4 = 104 points, the tonality:

* To compute the tonality, `mkeyscape` submits the notes expressed at each analysis point to the Krumhansl-Schmuckler algorithm, which establishes a Pearson correlation between the measured pitch class histogram and the predefined profiles for major and minor keys.
* At the eighth note granularity, the obtained data is quite chaotic. However, we want a bit of stability, and `mkeyscape` provides analysis results for all numbers of points less than the requested value:
  * for 104 points, values vary at *every* point
  * for 103 points, the measurement is much more stable. This is the value chosen for visualization
  * for 1 point, we obtain the *global* tonality of the piece

`mkeyscape` produces enough analyses to represent them in a triangle, where each line represents a different level of analysis granularity.

## Visualizing a Tonality

The colors are inspired by my daughter's synesthesia. *Major and relative minor* are merged.

For major keys, the root and the fifth are located on the outer circle, and linked to the minor third on the inner circle. For minor keys, it is the opposite.

This visualization technique arranges the keys around a circle in such a way that their geometric proximity reflects harmonic proximity.
