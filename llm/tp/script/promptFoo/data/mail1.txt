We are pleased to announce the First European Business Intelligence Summer
School. This summer school, presented by leading researchers in the field,
represents an opportunity for postgraduate students (PhD or MsC), postdoc
and other young researchers to equip themselves with the theoretical,
practical, and collaboration skills necessary for developing challenging
Business Intelligence applications. To ensure a high ratio between tutors
and students the school will be limited to 50 participants. Furthermore,
industrial presentations will allow participants to gain a deep
understanding of current product offer. 

 

The summer school will provide a stimulating and enjoyable environment in
which participants will benefit not only from the formal sessions but also
from informal and social interactions with established researchers and the
other participants in the school. To further facilitate communication and
feedback all attendees will present a poster on their own research. The
electronic copy of all course lectures will be available to participants
through the web site.
